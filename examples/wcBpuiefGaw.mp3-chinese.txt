[00:00.000 --> 00:05.520] 我们开始说一通来读几处的经文
[00:05.520 --> 00:11.320] 从《哥林多前书》第七章
[00:11.320 --> 00:19.760] 我们读从二十六节
[00:19.760 --> 00:25.040] 《哥林多前书》七章二十六节
[00:25.040 --> 00:29.520] I think that this is good in view of the present distress
[00:29.520 --> 00:33.160] that it is good for a man to remain as he is.
[00:33.160 --> 00:35.000] Are you bound to a wife?
[00:35.000 --> 00:37.360] Do not seek to be released.
[00:37.360 --> 00:39.000] Are you released from a wife?
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.360] Do not seek a wife.
[00:41.360 --> 00:44.000] But if you marry, you should have not sinned.
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.280] And if a virgin marries, she is not sinned.
[00:46.280 --> 00:48.760] Yet such will have trouble in this life.
[00:48.760 --> 00:52.080] And I am trying to spare you.
[00:52.080 --> 00:55.120] But this I say, brother, and the time has been shortened
[00:55.120 --> 00:58.520] so that from now on those who have wives
[00:58.520 --> 01:01.120] should be as those they had none
[01:01.120 --> 01:04.600] and those who weep as though they did not weep.
[01:04.600 --> 01:07.920] Those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice
[01:07.920 --> 01:11.400] and those who buy as though they did not possess.
[01:11.400 --> 01:16.800] Those who use the world as though they did not make full use of it.
[01:16.800 --> 01:20.920] For the form of this world is passing away.
[01:20.920 --> 01:24.800] I think that this is good in view of the present distress
[01:24.800 --> 01:28.280] that it is good for a man to remain as he is.
[01:28.280 --> 01:33.240] Are you bound to a wife?Do not seek to be released.
[01:33.240 --> 01:36.320] Are you released from a wife?Do not seek a wife.
[01:36.320 --> 01:38.720] But if you marry, you should have not sinned.
[01:38.720 --> 01:41.240] But if you marry, you should have not sinned.
[01:41.240 --> 01:44.120] And this will have trouble in this life.
[01:44.120 --> 01:46.560] And I am trying to spare you.
[01:46.560 --> 01:49.680] 弟兄們,我對你們說,時候減少了。
[01:49.680 --> 01:53.360] 從此以後,那有妻子的要像沒有妻子。
[01:53.360 --> 01:55.440] 哀哭的要像不哀哭。
[01:55.440 --> 01:57.520] 快樂的要像不快樂。
[01:57.520 --> 01:59.880] 自買的要像無有所得。
[01:59.880 --> 02:02.280] 用事物的要像不用事物。
[02:02.280 --> 02:06.240] 因為這世界的樣子將要過去了。
[02:06.240 --> 02:08.200] We'll read verse 31 again.
[02:08.200 --> 02:12.440] And this time we'll add the very first phrase of verse 32.
[02:12.440 --> 02:14.800] 我們再讀一遍三十一節。
[02:14.800 --> 02:19.520] And those who use the world as though they did not make full use of it.
[02:19.520 --> 02:22.960] For the form of this world is passing away.
[02:22.960 --> 02:26.960] But I want you to be free from concern.
[02:26.960 --> 02:30.040] 三十一節用事物的要像不用事物。
[02:30.040 --> 02:33.120] 因為這世界的樣子將要過去了。
[02:33.120 --> 02:35.200] 然後三十二節前半部分。
[02:35.200 --> 02:39.200] 我願你們無所掛慮。
[02:39.200 --> 02:41.120] Now let's turn also in the same book.
[02:41.120 --> 02:43.400] First Corinthians chapter 9.
[02:43.400 --> 02:45.800] 我們再翻到哥林多前書的九章。
[02:45.800 --> 02:47.880] And we'll start with verse 14.
[02:47.880 --> 02:49.640] 四十一節。
[02:49.640 --> 02:55.520] So also the Lord directed those who proclaim the gospel to get their living from the gospel.
[02:55.520 --> 02:57.120] But I've used none of these things.
[02:57.120 --> 03:01.120] I am not writing these things so that it would be done so in my case.
[03:01.120 --> 03:08.360] For it would be better for me to die than to have any man make my boast an empty one.
[03:08.360 --> 03:10.960] For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of.
[03:10.960 --> 03:13.160] For I am under compulsion.
[03:13.160 --> 03:17.160] For woe is me if I do not preach the gospel.
[03:17.160 --> 03:19.800] For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward.
[03:19.800 --> 03:24.160] But if it's against my will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.
[03:24.160 --> 03:26.440] What then is my reward?
[03:26.440 --> 03:28.960] That when I preach the gospel,
[03:28.960 --> 03:33.960] I may offer the gospel without charge.
[03:33.960 --> 03:35.400] 九章四十節。
[03:35.400 --> 03:41.400] So that no, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.
[03:41.400 --> 03:42.720] 九章四十節。
[03:42.720 --> 03:46.760] 主也是这样命定,叫传福音的靠着福音养生。
[03:46.760 --> 03:49.000] 但这全柄我全没有用过。
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.720] 我写这话并非要你们这样待我,
[03:51.720 --> 03:56.920] 因为我另可死也不教人使我所花的落了空。
[03:56.920 --> 03:59.040] 我传福音原没有可夸的,
[03:59.040 --> 04:01.160] 因为我是不得已的。
[04:01.160 --> 04:03.480] 若不传福音我便有祸了。
[04:03.480 --> 04:06.240] 我若甘心做这事就有赏赐。
[04:06.240 --> 04:09.320] 若不甘心责任却已经托付我了。
[04:09.320 --> 04:11.960] 既是这样我的赏赐是什么呢?
[04:11.960 --> 04:15.400] 就是我传福音的时候叫人不花钱得福音,
[04:15.400 --> 04:19.720] 免得用尽我传福音的全柄。
[04:19.720 --> 04:24.960] And again, let's read verse 18 one more time,
[04:24.960 --> 04:28.000] but this time we're going to read verse 19 with it.
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.720] 那我们再读一遍十八节以及十九节的前半部分。
[04:31.720 --> 04:33.560] What then is my reward?
[04:33.560 --> 04:35.120] That when I preach the gospel,
[04:35.120 --> 04:37.600] I may offer the gospel without charge.
[04:37.600 --> 04:41.920] So as not to make full use of my right
[04:41.920 --> 04:46.880] in the gospel, for though I am free from all men,
[04:46.880 --> 04:49.440] I have made myself a slave to all,
[04:49.440 --> 04:52.320] so that I may win more.
[04:52.320 --> 04:53.640] 十八十九节,
[04:53.640 --> 04:56.120] 其实这样我的赏赐是什么呢?
[04:56.120 --> 04:59.520] 就是我传福音的时候叫人不花钱得福音,
[04:59.520 --> 05:01.880] 免得用尽我传福音的全柄。
[05:01.880 --> 05:04.440] 我虽是自由的无人侠管,
[05:04.440 --> 05:07.040] 然而我甘心做了众人的普人,
[05:07.040 --> 05:09.120] 为要多得人。
[05:09.120 --> 05:13.720] And let's turn to our theme verse from Matthew 6 verse 10.
[05:13.720 --> 05:15.840] 那我们再翻到我们的主题经文,
[05:15.840 --> 05:18.840] 《马泰六章十节》
[05:18.840 --> 05:19.960] Your kingdom come,
[05:19.960 --> 05:24.040] your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[05:24.040 --> 05:26.880] 愿你的国降临,愿你的之意行在地上,
[05:26.880 --> 05:28.440] 如同行在天上。
[05:28.440 --> 05:29.680] And let's have a word of prayer.
[05:29.680 --> 05:31.920] 我们一同道告。
[05:31.920 --> 05:34.960] Father, we thank you for this chance to
[05:34.960 --> 05:37.880] let you speak to us through your word.
[05:37.880 --> 05:38.840] 我们在天上的父,
[05:38.840 --> 05:40.600] 我们感谢你给我们这样的机会
[05:40.600 --> 05:43.800] 能够借着你的自己的话语听你的话。
[05:43.800 --> 05:45.560] We trust, Lord, in your holy spirit
[05:45.560 --> 05:48.840] that you are the ones who gave Paul the words
[05:48.840 --> 05:52.600] in these letters to the Corinthians.
[05:52.600 --> 05:57.600] 我们的信号是圣灵使保罗写的这些书信给哥林多人。
[05:57.600 --> 06:02.160] And your word is active in living throughout the ages.
[06:02.160 --> 06:06.000] 并且你的话语历世历代都是活泼的。
[06:06.000 --> 06:09.040] And we trust in your holy spirit now to
[06:09.040 --> 06:12.440] bring to life what it is that you want to show us.
[06:12.440 --> 06:13.880] 我们求你圣灵,
[06:13.880 --> 06:17.480] 今天也把这些活化在我们的面前。
[06:17.480 --> 06:20.080] So we commit this time to you for speaking,
[06:20.080 --> 06:22.440] for translating, for hearing,
[06:22.440 --> 06:25.320] and for obeying.
[06:25.320 --> 06:27.960] 所以我们把这段时间也交在你的手里,
[06:27.960 --> 06:30.280] 无论是讲的、翻的、听的,
[06:30.280 --> 06:32.480] 我们都能够一同遵行你的话。
[06:32.480 --> 06:34.200] None of that can happen on our own,
[06:34.200 --> 06:37.920] where we trust in your empowering by your spirit.
[06:37.920 --> 06:41.560] 实在如果不是你的能力,我们不能够顺服。
[06:41.560 --> 06:44.000] We pray all this in the name of Jesus Christ.
[06:44.000 --> 06:45.960] 我们奉主耶稣的名求,
[06:45.960 --> 06:49.920] Amen.
[06:49.920 --> 06:55.680] So our focus today is on the phrase from our theme verse,
[06:55.680 --> 06:59.480] Thy kingdom come, or your kingdom come on earth.
[06:59.480 --> 07:03.560] 那我主题还是在主题经文里面的那一句说,
[07:03.560 --> 07:05.400] 你的国度降临。
[07:05.400 --> 07:08.120] And about three weeks ago,
[07:08.120 --> 07:13.080] Dana shared about how the Lord brings us through wilderness times,
[07:13.080 --> 07:15.200] personal wilderness times,
[07:15.200 --> 07:19.280] when we have an opportunity to hear the Lord in a different way.
[07:19.280 --> 07:20.520] 大概三周前,
[07:20.520 --> 07:22.400] Dana弟兄们分享到,
[07:22.400 --> 07:26.440] 我们每一个人都会经历那个矿野的时期,
[07:26.440 --> 07:30.680] 那是在那个时期我们能够更多的听到主的声音。
[07:30.680 --> 07:32.240] And last two weeks ago,
[07:32.240 --> 07:34.840] our brother Mingdao was sharing about
[07:34.840 --> 07:37.800] when we really want to let
[07:37.800 --> 07:40.840]  have his kingdom real in our personal life,
[07:40.840 --> 07:45.120] how important it is for us to be in fellowship with our father.
[07:45.120 --> 07:45.840] 那两周前,
[07:45.840 --> 07:47.440] Mingdao弟兄也讲到,
[07:47.440 --> 07:50.960] 要使这个国度在我们个人身上成为实际,
[07:50.960 --> 07:54.360] 就是与父的交通就非常的关键。
[07:54.360 --> 07:56.600] And I don't know if Mingdao is here today,
[07:56.600 --> 08:00.240] but two weeks ago,
[08:00.240 --> 08:02.280] he's downstairs,
[08:02.280 --> 08:04.040] two weeks ago he mentioned this verse,
[08:04.040 --> 08:05.240] he quoted this verse,
[08:05.240 --> 08:08.000] first Corinthians 7 verse 31。
[08:08.000 --> 08:08.720] 那两周前,
[08:08.720 --> 08:11.560] Mingdao弟兄其实也引用了这一节经文,
[08:11.560 --> 08:14.720] 就是哥林多成书七章三十一节。
[08:14.720 --> 08:15.760] And as he quoted that,
[08:15.760 --> 08:17.200] I looked it up and I was thinking,
[08:17.200 --> 08:17.600] you know,
[08:17.600 --> 08:19.480] I really don't understand this passage,
[08:19.480 --> 08:22.840] it's so unusual what Paul says here.
[08:22.840 --> 08:25.040] 那他引用了这一节的经文之后,
[08:25.040 --> 08:27.200] 我也去查考这个上下文,
[08:27.200 --> 08:28.200] 然后就想,
[08:28.200 --> 08:30.480] 宝螺写这个实在是非常的特别,
[08:30.480 --> 08:31.560] 我不能明白。
[08:31.560 --> 08:34.640] So I blame my brother for this today's message.
[08:34.640 --> 08:37.480] 所以我今天的信息都是因着那个弟兄,
[08:37.480 --> 08:39.440] Mingdao弟兄才有拆起来的。
[08:39.440 --> 08:42.280] But having looked at this and meditated before the Lord,
[08:42.280 --> 08:46.280] I really think that Paul is expressing a very deep concern
[08:46.280 --> 08:49.160] that is the Lord's concern for us.
[08:49.160 --> 08:51.440] 但是我就在那里读也思想,
[08:51.440 --> 08:53.320] 这里的章节的时候,
[08:53.320 --> 08:55.480] 我就感受到宝螺的一个负担,
[08:55.480 --> 08:58.000] 也是从主那里来的负担为着我们。
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.560] And we all know that Corinth was a place of tremendous cultural pressure
[09:02.560 --> 09:04.000] against the New Christians.
[09:04.000 --> 09:04.960] 那我们都知道,
[09:04.960 --> 09:08.880] 哥林多这个地方对基督徒特别是那些新的基督徒的,
[09:08.880 --> 09:11.840] 来说实在是有很大的文化上的压力。
[09:11.840 --> 09:15.040] They were surrounded by a culture that's opposed to the Lord,
[09:15.040 --> 09:18.280] and today we are surrounded by a culture
[09:18.280 --> 09:20.800] that actively opposes the Lord.
[09:20.800 --> 09:26.400] 那当时他们都被这个真的是抵挡神的这个文化来包裹,
[09:26.400 --> 09:28.320] 其实我们如今也是如此。
[09:28.320 --> 09:30.720] So we heard Paul in those verses I just quoted,
[09:30.720 --> 09:33.880] he talks about in the present distress.
[09:33.880 --> 09:36.320] 所以宝螺,我们刚才读了经文,
[09:36.320 --> 09:39.360] 在26节那里就讲到有现今的艰难。
[09:39.360 --> 09:42.080] And he speaks of the time is shortened.
[09:42.080 --> 09:44.560] 今天他讲到时候显少了。
[09:44.560 --> 09:46.560] And that definitely applies to us.
[09:46.560 --> 09:49.360] 实在这对于我们今天是何等的适用?
[09:49.440 --> 09:53.040] So let us see what the Lord wants to say to us through these verses.
[09:53.040 --> 09:56.720] 我们就一同来看主介这些话语要对我们说什么。
[09:56.720 --> 10:00.640] Now there's an interesting thing as we look at this chapter, it's seven.
[10:00.640 --> 10:02.480] Is that in chapter nine,
[10:02.480 --> 10:07.120] when Paul talks about this issue of whether we should be married or not.
[10:07.120 --> 10:12.960] No, when he talks about accepting wages.
[10:12.960 --> 10:16.720] 那我们看到宝螺第七章那里讲到婚姻第九章,
[10:16.720 --> 10:21.760] 九章那里又讲到这个服侍神是否要拿工价。
[10:21.760 --> 10:29.360] We're going to find that Paul is a living example of what he's telling us in chapter seven.
[10:29.360 --> 10:33.680] 但是我们要看到宝螺他自己是一个活的见证,
[10:33.680 --> 10:37.280] 他自己在第七章所说的,他是自己是那个见证。
[10:37.280 --> 10:39.200] That's why we're going to look at that part.
[10:39.200 --> 10:41.200] 所以我们先看这里。
[10:41.280 --> 10:43.520] So let's go back to chapter seven.
[10:43.520 --> 10:47.520] We're looking at specifically at twenty-six through thirty-two.
[10:47.520 --> 10:51.360] 我们看第七章二十六到十二节。
[10:51.360 --> 10:56.000] And in this chapter, Paul is dealing with various issues,
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.800] including the issue of sexual immorality.
[11:00.800 --> 11:05.360] 我们知道宝螺在这封书信里面他要对付不同的问题,
[11:05.360 --> 11:10.960] 其中一个是不是讲到在性上的这个不接近,
[11:10.960 --> 11:14.400] 这个不道德的事。
[11:14.400 --> 11:20.720] And so he says in verse eighteen of chapter six, he says flee immorality.
[11:20.720 --> 11:24.560] 所以第六章十八节那里就说你要逃避隐形。
[11:24.560 --> 11:31.040] He's talking there about how sins of the body are very severe.
[11:31.040 --> 11:35.440] 他那里就讲到你犯隐形是一个很重的罪。
[11:35.440 --> 11:40.880] As we sin against our own body, he says in verse eighteen.
[11:40.960 --> 11:46.240] 因为十八节那里说是得罪了自己的身子。
[11:46.240 --> 11:50.800] So he begins chapter seven with this verse, verse one.
[11:50.800 --> 11:52.960] Now concerning the things about which you wrote,
[11:52.960 --> 11:55.360] it is good for a man not to touch a woman,
[11:55.360 --> 11:57.120] but because of immorality,
[11:57.120 --> 11:59.120] each man is to have his own wife,
[11:59.120 --> 12:01.520] and each woman is to have her own husband.
[12:01.520 --> 12:03.600] 所以第七章他开始就说,
[12:03.600 --> 12:05.920] 论到你们信上所提的是,
[12:05.920 --> 12:08.400] 我说男不敬女倒好,
[12:08.400 --> 12:10.160] 但要免淫乱的事,
[12:10.160 --> 12:12.400] 男子当各有自己的妻子,
[12:12.400 --> 12:14.960] 女子也当各有自己的丈夫。
[12:14.960 --> 12:17.440] I'm smirking, I don't know if you can see I'm smirking,
